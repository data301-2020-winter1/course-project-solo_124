## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project) or [here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/data301/project/milestone01.html).

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{
This project is about finding the correlated relationship or causal relationship between all the factors with the average user ratings. 

What can be expectedÂ from this dataset analysis project is probably like something that can tell us what a high score mobile application normally has rather than what factors actually make an APP to be a high score application.

Knowing what 5 stars mobile APPs normally include probably will help me in app development.
